# Dotfiles
Dotfiles and configurations: not much here yet, and these are more for my benefit than the general public's - if you find them useful, that's awesome! The DWM scripts and configs are mostly the work of Old Tech Bloke, Derek Taylor (DistroTube) and Luke Smith, adapted by me, to use Font Awesome icons rather than Joy Pixels. The fogbell colours file is adapted from https://github.com/jaredgorski/fogbell.vim/blob/master/colors/fogbell.vim

With openscrobbler.com being a thing, there's no real need for a third party scrobbler like mpdscribble but I'll leave it here in case someone finds it useful.
