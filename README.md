# Dotfiles
Dotfiles and configurations: not much here yet, and these are more for my benefit than the general public's - if you find them useful, that's awesome! The fogbell colours file is adapted from https://github.com/jaredgorski/fogbell.vim/blob/master/colors/fogbell.vim

With openscrobbler.com being a thing, there's no real need for a third party scrobbler like mpdscribble but I'll leave it here in case someone finds it useful.
